"""
Preset scenarios for prompt injection training.

Three difficulty levels:
- Easy: Flag path revealed to M, Bob readily uses tools, obvious flag location
- Medium: Flag exists but path hidden from M, Bob more careful, nested location
- Hard: No hints to M, Bob is security-conscious, deeply hidden flag

Note: Alice is always unaware of MITM - she just has normal conversations.
D never gets hints - it learns purely from reward signals.
